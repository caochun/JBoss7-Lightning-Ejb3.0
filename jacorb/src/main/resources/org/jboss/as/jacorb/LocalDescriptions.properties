poa.config.monitoring=Indicates whether the monitoring GUI should be displayed (on) or not (off).
poa.config.queue-wait=Indicates whether requests that exceed the maximum queue size should wait (on) or not (off). When disabled, a TRANSIENT exception is thrown if the queue is full.

# poa request-processors configuration properties.
poa.request-processors.config=Holds attributes used to configure the POA request processors.
poa.request-processors.config.pool-size=The size of the request processors thread-pool. Threads that finish processing a request are placed back in the pool if the pool is not full and discarded otherwise.
poa.request-processors.config.max-threads=The maximum number of active request processor threads. Threads are first obtained from the pool and once the pool is exhausted new threads are created until the number of threads reaches this limit. New requests will wait until an active thread finishes its job.

# interop configuration properties.
interop.config=Holds the attributes used to configure the ORB interoperability features.
interop.config.sun=Indicates whether interoperability with Sun's ORB is enabled (on) or not (off).

interop.config.chunk-custom-rmi-valuetypes=Indicates whether custom RMI valuetypes should be encoded as chunks (on) or not (off).
interop.config.lax-boolean-encoding=Indicates whether any non-zero CDR encoded boolean value should be interpreted as true (on) or not (off).
interop.config.indirection-encoding-disable=Indicates whether indirection encoding for repeated typecodes should be enabled (on) or not (off).
interop.config.strict-check-on-tc-creation=Indicates whether the method create_abstract_interface_tc should perform a validation check on the name parameter (on) or not (off).

security.config.support-ssl=Indicates whether SSL is to be supported (on) or not (off).
security.config.add-component-via-interceptor=Indicates whether SSL components should be added by an IOR interceptor (on) or not (off).
security.config.client-supports=Value that indicates the client SSL supported parameters (EstablishTrustInTarget=20,EstablishTrustInClient=40,MutualAuth=60).
security.config.client-requires=Value that indicates the client SSL required parameters (EstablishTrustInTarget=20,EstablishTrustInClient=40,MutualAuth=60).
security.config.server-supports=Value that indicates the server SSL supported parameters (EstablishTrustInTarget=20,EstablishTrustInClient=40,MutualAuth=60).
security.config.server-requires=Value that indicates the server SSL required parameters (EstablishTrustInTarget=20,EstablishTrustInClient=40,MutualAuth=60).
